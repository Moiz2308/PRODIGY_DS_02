## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

### Task Goal
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights about the survival of passengers.

### Process
1.  **Loaded the data** from the provided CSV file.
2.  **Cleaned the data** by handling missing values in the 'Age' column by filling them with the mean age.
3.  **Performed analysis and visualization** to explore relationships between variables like survival, passenger class, sex, and age.

### Key Findings
My analysis revealed several key patterns:
* **Gender and Survival:** Women had a significantly higher rate of survival compared to men.
* **Passenger Class and Survival:** First-class passengers had a much higher chance of survival than those in third class.
* **Age and Survival:** Young children (below the age of 10) had a noticeably higher survival rate.

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
